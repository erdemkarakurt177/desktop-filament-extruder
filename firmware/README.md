## Desktop Plastic Filament Recycling & Extrusion System

This repository contains the firmware and documentation of a desktop-scale
plastic filament recycling system developed as a Bachelor's graduation
project at Middle East Technical University (METU).

The system converts waste thermoplastics into reusable 3D-printing filament
using a single-screw extrusion mechanism with PID-controlled heating.

### Key Features
- Arduino-based embedded control system
- PID temperature control with auto-tuning
- Multi-stepper motor coordination (extrusion, spool winding, traverse)
- Emphasis on energy efficiency and operational safety

### Academic Context
Bachelor’s Graduation Project – Mechanical Engineering, METU
